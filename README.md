# Group Media Recommender

A web application that generates personalized media recommendations for groups based on individual user preferences and consumption history. This app leverages OpenAI's o3 model to analyze multiple users' media history and preferences to suggest content everyone can enjoy together.

## Features

- Input media preferences for 2-5 users
- Collect Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix history
- Specify group preferences and mood/themes
- Generate AI-powered recommendations using OpenAI's o3 model
- Beautiful, responsive UI built with React and Bootstrap

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key with access to the o3 model

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd media-recommender
   npm install
   ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the server directory based on `.env.example` and add your OpenAI API key

## Running the Application

### Start the backend server
```
cd server
npm start
```

### Start the frontend development server
```
# In the project root directory
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
